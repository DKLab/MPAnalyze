Path Analyze --
  A)  Create another axes for sideview of data from zstack
    
    Total of three displays of data:
      1) Top down view
      2) Sideview (zstack)
      3) Scan data
    
    Allow user to set and move limits/margins in any of the three displays
    The limits should update simultaneously in all three displays.
    
    
  B)  Moving through scan data:
      Allow user to 'scroll' through scan data instead of just displaying the first 100 lines
      
    
  C)  Selecting scan data:
      Allow user to select regions to keep and regions to discard before calculating
      
      DISPLAY THE WINDOW -- overlay the window (width X time) on the data -- make it clear that calculations
      will be done in these window chunks.
      
      
  D)  Allow margins to be region specific? Allow users to name regions? (yes)

  



Diameter --
  Determine math for calculating diameter from following profile to replace FWHM
  
      Cylindar profiled by elipsoid (or rectangle)
      
      Noise: blood cells near edge
